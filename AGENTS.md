# AGENTS.md

Notes for anyone — human or otherwise — changing this repository.

## What this project is

An LLM-native SVG asset workspace

<!-- Replace this with the one paragraph that, if someone read only it, would -->
<!-- stop them proposing the wrong thing. Then list the invariants below.     -->

## Non-negotiable invariants

Each of these should be enforced by a hook or a test. An invariant nothing
checks is a comment, and it will be violated.

<!-- 1. **...** — enforced by `tests/....rs`. -->

## Layout

```
src/
├── lib.rs      the library surface
├── main.rs     the shaipe binary
├── cli.rs      argument types only
└── error.rs    the crate's error type
```

Dependencies point inward. Nothing in the library knows a command exists.

## Style

**Every non-obvious line carries a comment saying why.** Not what — the code
says what. Ideally naming the failure it prevents. A comment that restates the
code is worse than none.

**Errors are typed and actionable.** `thiserror` for the library, `miette` at
the binary edge. A diagnostic must carry the two things the user does not
already know: what specifically failed, and what to do about it. Diagnostic
codes are `shaipe::<module>::<kind>`, and a code is a public identifier
users grep for — renaming one is a breaking change.

**Test names are sentences.** `an_unchanged_input_produces_no_output`, not
`test_run_2`. The name should say what would be broken if it failed.

## Commits

Conventional Commits, enforced by commitlint on `commit-msg`. The type becomes a
changelog heading, so choose it as if someone will read it in release notes —
because they will.

## Releases

Driven by gh-ship. Never bump a version or push a tag by hand: `cliff.toml`
derives the version from the commit history, `prepare-release` applies it, and
`.github/ship.yml` is the contract between them. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Before you push

```sh
mise run ci
```

Formatting, Clippy, spelling, workflow linting, tests and the documentation build. Same as CI.

## This repository is generated from a template

The toolchain, hooks, CI and release workflows come from
[rust.tpl](https://github.com/noirbizarre/rust.tpl) and are updated with
`git tpl update`. Files carrying template-owned content end with a
`# --- project-specific ---` marker: add below it, never above.

Changing template-owned content here fixes it in one repository. Changing it in
the template fixes it in all of them — prefer that.
